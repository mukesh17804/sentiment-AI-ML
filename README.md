# Voice + Text Sentiment Analysis Using AI

This project was developed during my **Internship at MicroIT (Batch 21)** as part of my hands-on learning journey into AI, NLP, and real-time user interaction. It demonstrates how artificial intelligence can interpret human emotions from both **typed** and **spoken input**.

## üîç Project Overview

This application allows users to input text or use their voice to express a sentence. It then analyzes the emotional sentiment‚Äî**Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**‚Äîusing advanced Natural Language Processing techniques and deep learning.

Built using **Streamlit**, the app features a clean and responsive UI and offers both **speech-to-text conversion** and **real-time sentiment prediction** using a Transformer-based model from Hugging Face.

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Dual Input Modes**: Choose between text input or voice recording.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Real-time transcription of your voice using Google's SpeechRecognition API.
- **AI-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model from Hugging Face.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays model certainty for transparency.
- **Responsive Web App**: Streamlit-based frontend for user-friendly interaction.
